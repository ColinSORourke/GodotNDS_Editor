TripleE Rom Editor Plans
------------------------------------------
TripleE (Edit, Expand, Enjoy) will be a ROM Editor for the Gen IV Pokemon Games.
Inspired by PokEditor, HG-Engine, and a few others, it will provide the ability to not only edit, but expand, most major NARCs that run Pokemon Gen IV, and output a working ROM.


----- Basic Project Folder Functionality -----
The Launch Scene will ask user to create a new project or open an existing project.
	Create: Ask user for a name and location to create project folder.
		Given a name and valid location, it will create a folder with that name, place a Project.TXT inside the Folder
		And then transition to opening that project.
	Project: The Project Scene will display the contents of Project TXT, and have a close button.

----- Basic Narc Table Reading Functionality -----
There will be a NARCUtility node that can read from Table NARCs
	TableConfigure()
		Inputs: File, Column Array
		Any scene that wants to read from a given NARC first should call TableConfigure to initialize the reader.
	Read()
		Inputs: Row#
		Outputs: Decimal Values for each column in the given row.
		Errors: 
			If the given Size x Count x Row would produce an address outside of the table.

----- ROM Packing/Unpacking -----
Creating a new project will also ask for a ROM
The program will check if it's a ROM I know how to handle (Just English HeartGold initially)
	If it is not, we will throw a "Can't Create Project"
Then, in the project creation process, will unpack this rom into a file directory to manipulate inside the project folder.

In the Project Scene, will provide an export button that re-packs and saves the ROM.

----- Narc Table Editing Functionality -----
NARCUtility node will have the ability to write to Table.
	Write()
		Inputs: Row#, [Decimal Array]
		Outputs: Edits to the current Table File
		Errors: 
			If the Decimal Value for a given column is larger than that columns binary size.
			If fewer or greater values are given than spaces in the column.
